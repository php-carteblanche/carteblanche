Presentation
------------

**CarteBlanche** is a PHP framework constructed as an MVC application ready to work. It uses
a core library of classes that are enough to make it work and allows to develop some
extra features quickly in this environment.

It holds `bundles`, some packages to execute a feature, that could be exported after development
as a standalone PHP package (if so) ; it also proposes a set of `tools`, pretty simple
PHP classes, one per feature, to help building views.

The rendering is integrated in a ready-to-use (but very simple) global template coded in HTML5.
